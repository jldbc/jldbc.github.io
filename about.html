<p> I am a senior at Boston College studying economics and computer science. I've spent the past two summers working at Google and Unum, working as a Product Specialist and Data Analyst respectively. In these roles I've developed a background in working with data, developing applications to improve business processes, and managing large-scale projects from inception to launch.</p>
<p>Outside of work and school, I like to spend my time building statistical models and working with data. In the past this has meant building a literary recommender system with Python and Spark, modeling NFL field goal probabilities in R, and analyzing my daily coffee intake with Python and Google Sheets. More recently, I have been teaching myself TensorFlow and Keras by implementing various ML algorithms from scratch and experimenting with generative recurrent neural networks.</p>
<p>Feel free to reach out if you are interested in working on anything new. I am open to freelance opportunities, or to just having a chat.</p>
