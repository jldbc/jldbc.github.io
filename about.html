<p> I am a data scientist currently working at Major League Baseball. I split my time at MLB between machine learning and statistical modeling tasks for our streaming media product MLB.TV, the various professional baseball teams, and internal baseball research. </p>
<p> Outside of work I like to work with data relating to my personal life and interests. In the past this has meant building a literary recommender system with Python and Spark, modeling NFL field goal probabilities in R, and analyzing my daily coffee intake with Python. More recently, I have been working on a recently-released open source Python package for baseball data analysis called <a href="http://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball">pybaseball</a>. </p>
<p> I graduated from Boston College this past May, where I broadly studied statistical learning through a combination of coursework in machine learning, econometrics, and quantitative social science. I still study these topics today in my free time, and am currently working my way through <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Statistical-Learning-Prediction-Statistics/dp/0387848576">The Elements of Statistical Learning</a>. </p>

<p>Feel free to reach out if you are interested in working on something new. I am open to freelance opportunities, or to just having a chat.</p>
