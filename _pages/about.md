I'm a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Square, working on Cash App.

Prior to this I was a Staff Data Scientist at BuzzFeed, where I built content recommendation systems and led its advertising data science discipline. Prior to that, I was a a Data Scientist at MLB Advanced Media and a Solutions Consultant and Automation Engineer at Google.

In my free time I enjoy working on my Python package [pybaseball](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball), writing the [Baseball IQ](https://baseballiq.substack.com) baseball analytics newsletter, and staying up to date on machine learning systems, statistics, sports, and any combination of those things.

I earned my B.A. in Economics at Boston College, where my studies focused on statistical modeling, machine learning, data engineering, and quantitative social science. My research at this time focused on [natural language processing](https://psyarxiv.com/79bnu/) and [predictive methods in the social sciences](https://dlib.bc.edu/islandora/object/bc-ir%3A107437).
