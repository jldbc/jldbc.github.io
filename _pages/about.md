I'm a data scientist currently working as an analyst on BuzzFeed's Data Science Team. Prior to this I was a Solutions Consultant and Automation Engineer at Google and a Data Scientist at MLB Advanced Media.

In my free time I enjoy working on my Python package [Pybaseball](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball), working on miscellaneous data analysis and modeling projects, and reading about tech, statistics, sports, and any combination of those things.

I earned my B.A. in Economics at Boston College, where my studies focused on statistical modeling, machine learning, data engineering, and quantitative social science.
