I'm a data scientist currently working as an Analyst on BuzzFeed's Data Science team. Prior to this I was a Data Scientist at MLB Advanced Media and a Solutions Consultant and Automation Engineer at Google.

In my free time I enjoy working on my Python package [pybaseball](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball), working on miscellaneous data analysis and modeling projects, and reading about tech, statistics, sports, and any combination of those things.

I earned my B.A. in Economics at Boston College, where my studies focused on statistical modeling, machine learning, data engineering, and quantitative social science. My research at this time focused on [natural language processing](https://psyarxiv.com/79bnu/) and [predictive methods in the social sciences](https://dlib.bc.edu/islandora/object/bc-ir%3A107437).
